# Sampling API Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row Filtering Not Applying Correctly ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Filter expressions in sampling rounds were being completely ignored.

**Root Cause**: 
- Schema was empty (no columns defined) for the dataset
- Column validation was failing because the data was expected to be nested under a 'data' key, but it was actually at the top level
- Type mismatch - filter values needed to be converted to strings for JSONB comparisons

**Solution**:
- Updated `_get_valid_columns()` in `sampling_executor.py` to:
  - Fall back to sampling data when schema is empty
  - Look for columns at the top level of the data structure
- Updated `filter_parser.py` to:
  - Extract data directly from `r.data->>'column_name'` without nested structure
  - Convert all parameter values to strings for JSONB comparisons

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/saketh/Projects/dsa/src/workers/sampling_executor.py`
- `/home/saketh/Projects/dsa/src/features/sampling/services/filter_parser.py`

### 2. API Accepts Invalid Methods Without Validation ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The API was accepting any string as a sampling method without validation.

**Solution**: Added a Pydantic validator to the `SamplingRoundConfig` model that validates the method against a whitelist of allowed methods: `['random', 'stratified', 'systematic', 'cluster']`

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/saketh/Projects/dsa/src/api/sampling.py`

### 3. Residual Branch Access (404 Error) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: When `export_residual=True`, the residual data was being stored in the same commit but the API expected it to be in a separate branch.

**Solution**: Added code to create a separate residual branch (with `_residual` suffix) when residual data is exported.

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/saketh/Projects/dsa/src/workers/sampling_executor.py`

## Test Results

All three fixes have been successfully implemented and tested:

1. **Row Filtering**: Now correctly filters rows based on the provided expression
2. **Method Validation**: Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid sampling methods
3. **Residual Branch**: Creates and provides access to `{branch_name}_residual` branches

The sampling API is now functioning correctly with proper validation and filtering capabilities.
