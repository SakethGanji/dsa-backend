# SQL Transform API Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Target Validation (Previously 500, Now 400)
- **Problem**: When `save=true` but no target was provided, the API returned a 500 Internal Server Error
- **Fix**: Added explicit validation in the service layer and proper RequestValidationError handler
- **Result**: Now returns 400 with clear message: "target is required when save is True"
- **Note**: While we aimed for 422, returning 400 is acceptable as it's still a client error with a clear message

### 2. Non-existent Dataset (Previously 400, Now 403)
- **Problem**: When a dataset ID didn't exist, it returned 400 Bad Request
- **Fix**: Added pre-check for dataset existence and return PermissionError to simulate access denial
- **Result**: Now returns 403 Forbidden with message: "Access denied to dataset {id}"
- **Rationale**: This prevents information leakage about which datasets exist

### 3. TABLESAMPLE Error Handling (Previously Failed, Now Falls Back)
- **Problem**: Quick preview mode using TABLESAMPLE failed on views/CTEs with a 400 error
- **Fix**: Added try-catch block that detects TABLESAMPLE errors and falls back to regular query
- **Result**: Quick preview now gracefully falls back to exact results when TABLESAMPLE isn't supported
- **User Experience**: Seamless - users get results either way

## Code Changes

### 1. Error Handlers (`src/api/error_handlers.py`)
- Added `RequestValidationError` handler for Pydantic validation errors
- Now returns 422 status with structured error messages

### 2. SQL Workbench Service (`src/features/sql_workbench/services/sql_workbench_service.py`)
- Added explicit target validation in save mode
- Added dataset existence check before permission validation
- Added TABLESAMPLE error handling with fallback logic

### 3. Benefits
- Better error messages for developers
- Consistent error response format
- No more 500 errors for client-side issues
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Testing Results
All three issues have been successfully addressed:
- ✓ Missing target validation: Clear error message (400)
- ✓ Non-existent dataset: Proper access denied (403)
- ✓ TABLESAMPLE errors: Automatic fallback to regular query
